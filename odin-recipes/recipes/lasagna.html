<br>

Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
Cook noodles: Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Make meat sauce: Brown ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium heat. Drain off excess grease. Add onion and garlic, and cook until softened. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Assemble lasagna: In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer 6 lasagna noodles, half of the meat sauce, and half of the ricotta cheese. Top with half of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
Bake: Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until bubbly and cheese is melted. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
Optional variations:

Add vegetables like spinach or mushrooms to the meat sauce.
Use a different type of cheese, such as provolone or fontina.
Make a white lasagna by omitting the meat sauce and using a béchamel sauce instead.
Enjoy your homemade lasagna!
